When all seemed lost only Eighty Years Later, with rebellion across the globe, the efforts of the great Chagatayid general Timur allowed a second Mongol Peace to be restored by 1450.\n\nHowever, the World's 'Second Pax Mongolica' was not built like the first. Across Asia, Africa, and the West, pockets of anti-Mongol resistance have gradually strengthened. As of the 20th century, the 'Pax Mongolica' was a shadow of its former self, far from a 'worldwide peace,' or even an 'Asian peace.' However, the Sanjiang Revolution appears to be the end of that as well. For the first time in Six Hundred, the Yuan Dynasty, the Heart of the entire Mongol Empire, is on a precipice. If anything is certain, it is that the Five-hundred year Pax Mongolica is over."
