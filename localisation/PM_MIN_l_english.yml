 ming.4.t:0 "The Ming Empire"
 ming.4.d:0 "In 1404, the Ming Dynasty emerged supreme over China after a sixty year struggle, simultaneously destroying Pax Mongolica which had controlled the world for a hundred years. However, the celebrations were brief, only two years later, Tamerlane, the conqueror of India, invaded China and reinstalled the Khagan in Khanbaliq. Over the next two hundred years, the Ming Dynasty was unable to recover from this loss, gradually losing territory to the Yuan empire. By 1620, the Ming remnants had fled to Formosa, where forces under general Zheng Shaozu staged a military coup against the Ming Emperor, establishing a Military Junta.\n\nAlthough able to ward off Mongol attempts to retake the island, the Ming remnant has for long been seen as incapable of reconquering the mainland. However, this would change with the fall of the Golden Horde and the rise of Europe. With western aid, Tungning was able to industrialize, and establish a navy greatly outpowering that of the Yuan. With the Mongol empire on a permanant decline, it would now only take a spark to destroy it once and for all... and restore the Ming Empire to its rightful throne..."
